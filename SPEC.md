So here's the thing. My wife is trying to learn German in preparation for a holiday that we're planning later this year. She studied German at high school and is quite good at it, but hasn't studied it for a few years. She wants to just have good conversational German for our holiday. 

She's using a variety of tools to study German, including Duolingo, the famous language app. But what she's asked for is a slow German news reader. This is an app that would go and get the latest news, major world affairs, geopolitics, the sort of thing you might find on the BBC news site, and speaks it in German, slowly and at different levels of difficulty. 

I could imagine an app, for example, that allows you to dial up the news complexity at one of five levels. Perhaps play something back, slow it down, speed it up perhaps, have more complex and less complex versions of the same information. Maybe have the news text translated so you can check your understanding. Maybe in a sophisticated way, it could even ask you some questions about the news after you've listened to it. She would mostly want to run this from her iPhone, whether that's accessing a website or as a native app. 

I thought it might be fun to brainstorm what kind of product we might be able to build.
